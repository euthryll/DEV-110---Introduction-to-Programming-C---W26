# Week 1: Hello, GitHub - Study Notes

**Name:**
Yanlin Tang
## Development Environment Setup

**Software installed and versions:**
[List each piece of software you installed: .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, Git, and any VS Code extensions]

Answer:.NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, Git, Github Classroom, Github Copilot Chat, .NET Install Tool, Better Comments, C#, C# Dev Kit, EditorConfig for VS Code, GitHub Actions, Github Pull Requests, indent-rainbow, Live Share, Markdown All in One, Github Copilot

**Operating system:**
[What OS are you using? Windows, macOS, or Linux?]

Answer:Windows

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge during setup:**
[What was the hardest part? Installing software, configuring VS Code, understanding the terminal, or something else?]

Answer: There were 2 really hard parts where I genuinely considered laying down on my bed and sobbing into a pillow for 5 minutes, but I think the hardest was trying to fight Microsoft's automated systems to try and prove that I was a student.

**How you solved it:**
[Explain what you did to overcome the challenge - search online, ask for help, restart your computer, etc.]

Answer: I asked a friend for help and he gave me some guidance that let me find something that Microsoft accepts as proof.

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand? Git commands, terminal navigation, C# syntax, or dotnet CLI?]

Answer:I think the instructions for cloning may have been the hardest purely because I didn't know the instructions were for MacOS and not windows, so I spent 3 hours trying everything before giving up and posting on the forum. Keyboard shortcuts were also really hard to understand as I was trying to edit commands and copying and pasting. But the different keyboard shortcuts made it really weird and confusing for me.

## Understanding C# Basics

**What does `Console.WriteLine()` do?**
[Explain in your own words what this command does]

Answer: it tells the console/terminal to give you a text output

**What is the purpose of `Program.cs`?**
[Why is this file important in a C# project?]

Answer:It's where the code is stored/where the code starts to run. So without it the code doesn't have a place to run/start running

**What does `dotnet run` do?**
[Explain what happens when you run this command]

Answer:It "activates" the code to begin whatever you've programmed it to do.

## Git Workflow Understanding

**What is the difference between `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`?**
[Explain each command and when you would use it]

Answer: 'git add' adds files to the "package" you'd want to upload to github . 'git commit' adds them to the local repository and saves it as a change. 'git push' gives them to the actual online repository from your local repository.

**Why do we create branches?**
[Explain the purpose of creating a student branch]

Answer: We create branches so that we can have different versions of the code, if the newest branch is bad or messes something up it won't mess with the rest of the code until approved.

## What I Learned

**Key takeaways from this week:**
[What are the 3 most important things you learned?]

1. How to use github
2. How to connect github to my local pc
3. What some commands or keywords mean

**How this connects to professional development:**
[Why are these skills important for programmers?]

Answer: When you're programming something you're most likely going to use github in some way or form, so it's good to learn it now before you're in an actual work environment and realize you don't know how to use one of the basic website/applications. Knowing what commands/keywords do what is also important or otherwise you'd be unable to program efficiently

## Time Spent

**Total time:** 5 hours

**Breakdown:**

-   Installing and configuring software: .5 hours
-   Learning terminal/command line basics: .5 hours
-   Writing the "Hello, GitHub!" program: .1 hours
-   Understanding Git workflow: 3 hours
-   Testing and fixing issues: .4 hours
-   Writing documentation: .5 hours

**Most time-consuming part:** [Which aspect took the longest and why?]

Answer: Fighting Microsoft aside it was really a struggle to understand the Git workflow because I didn't know that the commands in the lectures/assignments were meant for mac, so I literally deleted the cloned repository/folder off my computer like three times to trying cloning it again only for it to still not work.
